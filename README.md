# Projects by Nik Kovitz
Most of my professional work is proprietary/unsharable, so I took it upon myself to do a few side projects to stretch my skills.

This site is the homepage for the URLs to all my public projects. Enjoy!

### My Games Tracker - A lightweight Angular project
I focused on honing my UX/UI skills to display data graphs with an engaging, sleek interface. Check it out!

### Angel Droid - A video game I created with Unity
I did my best to craft the whole game from scratch (code, animations, graphics, etc).
I wrote all the music too!
